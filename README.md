**eVik** is not just a tech project — it's a movement.

## 🌱 Why eVik?

Every broken phone, outdated laptop, or forgotten charger has a story — and a consequence.

Mountains of e-waste fill landfills every year, leaking toxins into soil, water, and air. But it doesn’t have to be this way.

**eVik** is a call to action.  
A platform where you can say:  
**"I choose to be part of the solution."**
